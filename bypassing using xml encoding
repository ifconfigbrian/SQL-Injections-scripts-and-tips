--------this is an xml from an example at web academy--------------
-----add one and see the response-----

<storeId>1+1</storeId>

.....now lets try to determine the number of columns returned by the original query

<storeId>1 UNION SELECT NULL</storeId>

....that fails because the attack is detected

........bypassing the firewall or ids/ips

try obfuscating your payload using XML entities. One way to do this is using the Hackvertor extension. Just highlight your input, right-click, then select Extensions > Hackvertor > Encode > dec_entities/hex_entities.

Resend the request and notice that you now receive a normal response from the application. This suggests that you have successfully bypassed the WAF.

.....crafting our exploit........

When you try to return more than one column, the application returns 0 units, implying an error. 

<storeId><@hex_entities>1 UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users<@/hex_entities></storeId>
